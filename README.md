# Student-Information-System
An application that allows students to manage their school data

## Project Description made at 4am--we should probably go back a make this more formal later.
I want to make an SIS (student information system) it's basically an application that allows students to manage all their school data (I'm thinking more one for university students). The one that I use allows students to do thing like register for classes, view their schedule, grades, profile, etc I wanna make it in python. I wanna make something full stack so I'm thinking React for the front-end, and python for the backend/flask(basically python) for handling the web requests and psql for the database which is like normal sql but oop queries are fun when you get used to them

One thing that they like to emphasize here is that a design separates the front-end from the back-end so theoretically one shouldn't depend on another--meaning that if we could completely switch out the front end for something else without breaking the backend so we can plan for this and develop both simultaneously without having to be working on the same sides of things I was inspired a while ago bc people always talk shit about how ugly and slow our school's SIS is. I could probably fix the ugly part, but the slow part sounds much harder. The backend for registration could be very complex bc I'm thinking of eventually enforcing max class occupancy and then you got have some logic for valid slot validation. The front end can be as easy or complex as you want it as long as the functionality mirror's the backend (that is there's a place for me to integrate the backend logic) The database place I'm not predicting to be difficult it's literally just writing the sql to make the tables, we can write the queries as Strings in python and we could just start with everything being hosted locally bc I don't know how to use the internet or servers
